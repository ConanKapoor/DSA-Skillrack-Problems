ALGORITHM:-
STEP1 - Include stdlib library.
STEP2 - Form a structure with data as int and 2 pointers next and prev.
STEP3 - Initiate a global variable n as int.
STEP4 - Form InsertEnd function to insert the values in a linked list.
STEP5 - Form swap function to swap adjacent nodes.
STEP6 - Form display function to display the changed linked list.
STEP7 - In main function, initiate i and val as int.
STEP8 - Assign head and tail as NULL.
STEP9 - Read the number of nodes and save in n.
STEP10 - Read the values and use InsertEnd function to add in linked list.
STEP11 - Call swap function by giving head as variable to swap nodes.
STEP12 - Call display function to display the swapped nodes.
