Input for the problem:-

1)Choice of operation, ch.
2)If ch= ‘a’ or ‘c’, then the next line contains the element to be inserted - x
---------------------------------------
Processing involved:-

- Initialize global variables - array of length 10, i=0, b=0 and d=0 as int.
- Form a structure for a queue node.
- Form is_Empty function to check if queue is empty.
- Form front_Insert function to insert data in queue from front.
- Form rear_Insert function to insert data in queue from rear.
- Form front_Delete function to delete data from data from front of the queue
- Form rear_Delete function to delete data from data from rear of the queue
- Form Display function to print the modified queue.
- In main function, form a do while loop in which read character and form a switch statement for 5 choices till character!='e' || (b==0 && d==0).
- Call is_Empty function.
------------------------------------------
Output for the problem:-

1)If ch =  ‘b’ or ‘d’, then the line contains the front or rear element respectively that got deleted recently.
2)If ch= ‘e’ and the queue is not empty then

    A line contains the  1st element
    Next line contains the 2nd element
    …
    Last line contains the last element

Or if empty then
    
     Queue is empty
-------------------------------------------
Solution alternatives:-

Form a instruction function in which write a menu of options and just call instructions function in do-while loop.
