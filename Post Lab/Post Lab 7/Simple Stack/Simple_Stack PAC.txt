Input for the problem:-

A string containing alphabets and * - strng.
---------------------------------------
Processing involved:-

- Define MAXSIZE as 100.
- Form a structure for stack.
- Typedef the structure - typedef struct stack STACK; and do STACK s;
- Initialize push and pop functions.
- In main function, initialize s.top=-1.
- Read string.
- Iterate through i=0 to strlen(string)-1 and check the conditions for push and pop-
- Iterate through i=0 to length-1 and print.
- Form a push function with char alpha as attribute to carry out push operation.
- Form a pop function to do pop operation.
------------------------------------------
Output for the problem:-

A string containing only the alphabets in the input string.
-------------------------------------------
Solution alternatives:-

1)Form a display function.
2)Check conditions in a function.
