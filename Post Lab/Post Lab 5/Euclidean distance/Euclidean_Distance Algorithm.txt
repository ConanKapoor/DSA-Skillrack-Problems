ALGORITHM:-
STEP1 - Form a structure "point" with x and y as int.
STEP2 - In main function, initialize i and ratio as int.
STEP3 - make point1,point2 and middle as point data type.
STEP4 - Do point.x=0 and point.y=0.
STEP4 - Read x coordinate and save in point2.x and y coordinate in point2.y.
STEP5 - Find middle for both x and y coordinate.
STEP6 - If point2.y<point2.x then - 
        ratio=point2.x/point2.y;
        for(i=0;i<middle.y;i++)
        {
            point1.x=point1.x+ratio;
            point1.y=point1.y+1;
            printf("%d\n%d\n",point1.x,point1.y);
        }
STEP8 - Otherwise, 
        ratio=point2.y/point2.x;
        for(i=0;i<middle.x;i++)
        {
            point1.x=point1.x+1;
            point1.y=point1.y+ratio;
            printf("%d\n%d\n",point1.x,point1.y);
        }
