Input for the problem:-

1)Number of jobs waiting in the queue -  n
2)The subsequent lines contains the following information
    Id of 1st job
    Name of the 1st job
    Service time of the 1st job
    ....    
    Id of nth job
    Name of the nth job
    Service time of the nth job
3)Time ‘t’
---------------------------------------
Processing involved:-

- Form a structure Jobs with job_id and time as int and jobname of length 20 as char.
- Form a structure queue with a of length of 10 as struct Jobs and front and rear as int.
- Form IsFull and IsEmpty function to check for the same.
- Form Enqueue and Dequeue functions to enqueue and dequeue values in a queue.
- Form display function to print the results.
- In main function, Read n.
- Iterate i from 0 to n and Initialize struct Jobs *K and Initialize K=malloc(sizeof (struct Jobs))
- Inside loop Read job_id,job_name and time and enqueue the values.
- Read Time.
- While Time>0, do Time-=x.a[x.front].time; and Dequeue(&x).
- Call display function.
------------------------------------------
Output for the problem:-

If the queue is not empty, the print the details of the jobs in the queue at time t as shown below:

1)Id of current 1st job
2)Name of the current 1st job
3)Id of last job
4)Name of the last job

If the queue is empty
    Print “No job is waiting”
-------------------------------------------
Solution alternatives:-

Do everything in main function instead of making isFull and isEmpty functions.
