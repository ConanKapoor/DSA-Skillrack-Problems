Input for the problem:-

1)No. of. Samples to be drawn - N
2)The next line will contain the samples drawn
---------------------------------------
Processing involved:-

- Form a structure for node and initialize val and flag as int and struct node *link.
- Form a get_node function.
- Form a read_node function to read data and storing in linked list.
- Form insert_end function to insert data at the end of linked list.
- Form sorting function to sort data in linked list using bubble sort.
- In main function, read num.
- Call get_node function.
- Read the value - scanf("%d",&(new_node->val))
- Iterate through i=0 to num-1 and call insert_end function.
- Call sorting function on head.
- Loop till head!=NULL and print value and count.
------------------------------------------
Output for the problem:-

The first 2N lines will print the ordered data value followed by its count.
-------------------------------------------
Solution alternatives:-

1)Do sorting using other form of sorts..i.e. insertion sort,selection sort etc.
2)We can read node in main function itself instead of making a separate function.
