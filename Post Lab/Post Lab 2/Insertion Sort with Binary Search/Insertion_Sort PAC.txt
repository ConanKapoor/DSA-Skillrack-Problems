Input for the problem:-

Number of integers - N
Next ‘N’ lines - integers
---------------------------------------
Processing involved:-

- Form a function to perform binary search from the inputted array and find the location to perform insertion sort.
- Form a function to perform insertion sort from the location taken by calling binary search function inside insertion sort function.
- In main function, read the value of n.
- Read the n number of inputs and store in an array.
- Call the insertion sort function with the array and n as arguments.
- Print the array.
------------------------------------------
Output for the problem:-

N lines of integers in descending order.
-------------------------------------------
Solution alternatives:-

- By using binary search and insertion sort inside the main function only.
