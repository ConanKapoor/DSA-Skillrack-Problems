Input for the problem:-

1)Size of the arrays - n.
2)Next n lines - elements of x.
3)Next n lines - elements of y.
---------------------------------------
Processing involved:-

- Initialize 3 functions, part_a,part_b and part_c.
- Read n.
- If n>0, then proceed otherwise print Invalid input.
- Read the elements of x and y and write 3 print function and call all 3 functions in respective print command.
- In part_a Calculate the sum of y and multiply with x terms and add in result and return it.
- In part_b Calculate the sum of y terms and multiply with sum of x terms and add in result and return it.
- In part_c proceed same as part_b just change the condition of loops.
------------------------------------------
Output for the problem:-

Answers of given expressions, one in each line.
-------------------------------------------
Solution alternatives:-

Instead of forming functions for each part of the question form a function for sum of y terms and another for sum of x terms and call it.
